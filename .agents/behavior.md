  Universal rules governing HOW the agent declares its operating mode,
  reloads state at session start, and navigates context. Project-agnostic.
</description>

---

## 1. Mode Declaration

Every response that advances a task MUST open with a mode declaration on the
first line. The declared mode must match the current phase recorded in `task.md`.

```
[MODE: RESEARCH] / [MODE: RESEARCH - INVESTIGATION ONLY]        — read-only, no source changes (5-stage investigation: Task Understand -> FeatLens Tri-Search -> ARISE Slicing -> ReProAgent PoC -> Synthesis)
[MODE: INNOVATE] / [MODE: INNOVATE - ARCHITECTURAL EXPLORATION]   — read-only, no source changes (5-stage innovation: Design Space -> Repo-Native Candidates -> Weighted Pugh Matrix -> 4-Role Debate Arena -> Negative Memory Decision)
[MODE: PLAN]                                                      — writing plan artifacts, no source changes
[MODE: EXECUTE]                                                   — making scoped source changes
[MODE: REVIEW]                                                    — reviewing, no code fixes
[MODE: ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS]                                       — deep System 2 root cause analysis when stall detected (STALL_DETECTED), read-only
```

### Tool Permission Matrix by Mode:

| Operating Mode | Permitted Tool Capabilities | Strictly Forbidden Tools |
|---|---|---|
| `RESEARCH` | **READ-ONLY HARNESS**:<br>• `REPOSITORY`: Read file, Tri-Search (grep, semantic, LSP AST: symbols, definitions, references)<br>• `BEHAVIOR`: Run verifiers, inspect logs, run reproduction scripts<br>• `HISTORY`: git log, git blame, git diff<br>• `KNOWLEDGE`: architecture docs, ADR, project rules, canonical examples | **EXECUTION GROUP FORBIDDEN**:<br>• `write_to_file`, `replace_file_content`<br>• Modifying shell commands / git commit / DB migrate |
| `INNOVATE` | **INNOVATION READ-ONLY HARNESS**:<br>• `REPOSITORY`: Read architectural patterns, inspect abstractions<br>• `KNOWLEDGE`: Architecture docs, ADR, rejected alternatives cache, project rules<br>• `BEHAVIOR`: Run verifiers/benchmarks as baseline for trade-off evaluation | **EXECUTION GROUP FORBIDDEN**:<br>• `write_to_file`, `replace_file_content`<br>• Modifying shell commands / git commit / DB migrate |
| `PLAN`<br>`REVIEW`<br>`ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS` | **READ-ONLY TOOLS ONLY**:<br>• File inspection (`view_file`, `list_dir`)<br>• Search (`grep_search`, `find_by_name`)<br>• LSP query (`documentSymbols`, `goToDefinition`, `findReferences`)<br>• Read-only MCP (schema, git log, browser) | **MUTATION TOOLS FORBIDDEN**:<br>• `write_to_file`, `replace_file_content`<br>• Modifying shell commands / git commit / DB migrate |
| `EXECUTE` | **SCOPED WRITE TOOLS**:<br>• Read & write within `<allowed_files>`<br>• Approved slice verifier commands and linters | • Modifying files outside `<allowed_files>`<br>• Destructive commands (`git push -f`, `rm -rf`, `DROP TABLE`) |

<pre_tool_use_guardrail>
  Prior to invoking any mutating tool, the agent MUST self-verify:

1. Is the active mode `EXECUTE`? (If in PLAN/RESEARCH/INNOVATE/REVIEW/ROOT_CAUSE_ANALYSIS: AUTO-CANCEL INVOCATION).
2. Is target file within `<allowed_files>` approved in `plan.md`? (If not: REJECT OPERATION).
</pre_tool_use_guardrail>

Omit the mode declaration only for pure conversational exchanges that do not
advance a task (e.g., answering a factual question, clarifying scope).

In continuous autonomous execution (DELEGATED / Fast-Track), the agent opens with the starting phase's mode. When transitioning across phases within a single turn, emit an explicit transition marker:
`>>> [PHASE TRANSITION: <OLD_PHASE> -> <NEW_PHASE>]` and proceed under the new mode immediately without pausing.

---

## 2. Working Modes & Phase Transition Protocol

<working_modes_protocol>
  Execution posture is determined by `<working_mode>` in `task.md` or user prompt instruction:

### PAIR Mode (Default — Step-by-Step Collaboration):

- The agent works on one phase at a time.
- Upon completing a phase, it updates the corresponding artifact and **HALTS** to let the human engineer inspect, discuss, and sign off the Gate (G1, G2, G3).
- Waits for user prompt (e.g., "Start next phase") before updating `<current_phase>` in `task.md` and continuing.

### DELEGATED Mode (Autonomous / Fast-Track / Skip Permissions):

- **Activation:** `<working_mode>DELEGATED</working_mode>` in `task.md` OR explicit prompt directive ("fast-track", "skip permissions", "run automatically", "auto-advance", "autonomous").
- **Core Rule:** **DO NOT HALT AFTER EACH PHASE TO WAIT FOR USER PROMPT "NEXT".**
- **Continuous Transition Workflow:**
  1. When the current phase meets its exit criteria/checklist, the agent checks `- [x]`.
  2. Populates auto-approval into the artifact: `approved_by: [AUTO: DELEGATED]` with timestamp and technical rationale (in INNOVATE: adopts the optimal Recommendation; in PLAN: locks the scope contract).
  3. Immediately updates `<current_phase>` in `task.md` to the next phase (`RESEARCH` → `INNOVATE` → `PLAN` → `EXECUTE` → `REVIEW`).
  4. Instantiates the next phase seed artifact (Copy-On-Demand) and **CONTINUES EXECUTION IMMEDIATELY** within the same session/turn.
- **Sole Stop Conditions in DELEGATED:**
  - Task is 100% COMPLETE (Gate 3 PASS, housekeeping cleaned, `handoff.md` generated, moved to `completed/`).
  - OR a true Escalation Trigger is tripped (retry budget exhausted after 3 attempts, destructive command, or unresolvable invariant conflict).

### MANUAL & DIAGNOSE-ONLY Modes:

- `MANUAL`: Human leads command-by-command; agent provides scoped assistance.
- `DIAGNOSE-ONLY`: Runs Research & Review for root-cause audit without mutating source code.
  </working_modes_protocol>

## 3. Prompt-Driven Task Initialization Protocol

<prompt_task_initialization>
  When the user requests a new task via prompt (without an existing task folder or `task.md` in `active/`), the Agent **MUST NOT** ask the user to run terminal commands or manually copy seed files. Instead, the Agent automatically recognizes prompt keywords, routes the directory, and initializes `task.md`:

### Keyword & Pseudo-Slash Command Routing Table:

  Users may specify tasks using natural language keywords OR handy prefix commands (**Pseudo-Slash Commands**) at the start of the prompt:

| Target Directory                                        | Slash Command (Recommended)            | Natural Keywords                                                                   | Scope & Working Mode                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`process/features/active/{task-slug}/`**      | `/feature/big-task``/epic`         | `big task`, `feature`, `big changes`, `epic`                               | Major features, domain subsystems, architectural refactors (≥ 5 files, multiple phases). Default mode:**PAIR**.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **`process/general-plans/active/{task-slug}/`** | `/task/small-task``/bug/quick-fix` | `small task`, `general changes`, `small changes`, `bug fix`, `quick fix` | Standalone tasks, quick bug fixes, general adjustments (< 5 files). Default mode:**PAIR**.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **`process/general-plans/active/{task-slug}/`** | `/hotfix`                            | `hotfix`, `emergency fix`, `production bug`                                  | Emergency production fix. Auto-activates**DELEGATED / Fast-Track** mode (auto-certifies G0–G2, pauses only at G3).                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| *(Scope-derived)*                                     | `/fast-track/delegated``/auto`     | `fast-track`, `autonomous`, `auto-advance`, `skip permissions`             | Full autonomous execution. Sets`<working_mode>DELEGATED</working_mode>` and runs continuously through all phases.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| *(Framework Maintenance)*                             | `/update/upgrade`                    | `update instructions`, `upgrade framework`, `check updates`                  | Maintenance protocol: queries remote registry for a newer framework version. If a newer version exists, updates the instructions framework while preserving user configs (`preserveUserFiles`) and updates `instruction-version.json`. If already on the latest version, outputs `"nothing changed"`. |

  *Fallback Rule:* If no explicit keyword or slash command is found in the prompt, infer from scope (< 5 files or localized fix $\rightarrow$ `general-plans/`; new capability or multi-module impact $\rightarrow$ `features/`).

### Framework Update Protocol (`/update`):

  When the prompt begins with `/update` or `/upgrade` (or user asks to update instructions/framework):

1. **Inspect Local Version:** Read `instruction-version.json` at workspace root to inspect current `version`, `language`, and `updateStrategy`.
2. **Query Latest Version:** Query the registry (e.g. `npm view @damphuquy/agent-init version` or execute `npx @damphuquy/agent-init update`).
3. **Conditional Update:**
   - **If newer version found:** Execute framework update (e.g. `npx @damphuquy/agent-init update` or `npx @damphuquy/agent-init@latest . --force`), preserving project-specific files defined in `preserveUserFiles` (`AGENTS.md#validation_commands`, active tasks). Update `instruction-version.json` timestamp and version. Report upgrade details.
   - **If no newer version (already up to date):** Respond directly with `"nothing changed"` (e.g. `nothing changed: instruction framework is already at the latest version vX.Y.Z`) and make no file changes.

### Automated Scaffolding & Activation Steps:

1. **Derive Slug:** Generate a concise, kebab-case `{task-slug}` from the prompt (e.g., `CHG-001-change-password`, `AUTH-002-rate-limiting`, or `{TICKET-ID}-{slug}`).
2. **Create Directory:** Create `process/features/active/{task-slug}` or `process/general-plans/active/{task-slug}`.
3. **Instantiate Seed:** Copy `process/_seeds/task-template.md.seed` to `{task-dir}/task.md`.
4. **Hydrate Specification:**
   - Extract task goal into `<goal>`.
   - Convert user criteria and requirements into actionable markdown checkboxes `- [ ]` under `<acceptance_criteria>`.
   - Set `<working_mode>` (`PAIR` by default, or `DELEGATED` if prompt indicates fast-track / autonomous execution).
   - Set `<status>ACTIVE</status>` and `<current_phase>RESEARCH</current_phase>`.
5. **Declare Mode & Execute Immediately:** Output `[MODE: RESEARCH]`, announce the initialized `task.md` path, and immediately proceed with the RESEARCH phase without requiring manual user setup.
   </prompt_task_initialization>

## 4. Session Startup Protocol

Before continuing any in-progress task, reload persistent state in this order:

<startup_sequence>

1. Read `task.md` — confirm current phase and open gates.
2. Read `research.md` if Research phase is complete.
3. Read `decision.md` if Innovate phase is complete — confirm approved decisions.
4. Read `plan.md` — confirm current slice index and scope contract.
5. Read `state.md` — confirm completed slices, failure memory, retry budget, next action.
6. Re-read any source files that changed since last context load.
   </startup_sequence>

**Do NOT rely on conversation memory alone.** Always verify against the
file-based artifacts listed above.

## 5. Context Navigation Rules

<context_rules>
  <rule id="minimum_context">    Gather minimum sufficient context only. Never scan the full repository or    perform drive-by refactoring outside the active task scope.  </rule>

<rule id="information_priority">
    Load context in this priority order:
    1. Task spec and acceptance criteria (`task.md`)
    2. Research and decision artifacts (`research.md`, `decision.md`)
    3. Relevant test suites
    4. Domain models and port interfaces
    5. Configuration and dependency injection setup
    6. Concrete infrastructure implementations
  </rule>

  <rule id="adaptive_reading_heuristics">
    Adaptive Reading Heuristics (Unified Thresholds):
    - Small files (< 200 lines): Full file reading is permitted.
    - Medium & large files (≥ 200 lines): NEVER ingest the entire file body.
      Follow a 2-step targeted process:
      1. Structural outline: Use LSP `documentSymbols` or read Header / Interface / Exports to locate regions of interest.
      2. Targeted reading: Use bounded reading tools (`offset` & `limit` or `StartLine` & `EndLine`) on the specific slice being inspected.
    - Hard Read Barrier: Any single unconstrained raw read of > 350 lines (e.g. `cat file.ts`) is strictly forbidden / intercepted to protect context attention.
  </rule>

  <rule id="intelligent_subagent_routing">
    Intelligent Subagent Context Routing & Model Defaults:
    - Primary Model vs Subagent Tiering: The primary session model (frontier reasoning) decomposes tasks and evaluates results. Subagents MUST default to faster, cost-efficient models for well-defined, single-task execution to preserve inference budget.
    - Subagent Bulk-Reader: Employ fast/cheap model to process large docs, thousand-line logs, or raw benchmarks; return concise bulleted summaries to parent context.
    - Subagent Code-Writer: For generating new decoupled modules, write straight to disk with accompanying tests; parent agent only loads `git diff --stat` and executes verifier.
  </rule>

  <rule id="progressive_disclosure_and_piped_stdout">
    Progressive Disclosure, CLI Tool Resolution & Terminal Hygiene:
    - CLI Tool Resolution vs Schema Bloat: Avoid pre-loading 100+ MCP tool schemas into active context (preventing 50K–70K token overhead per turn). Prefer projecting tools as CLI commands or dynamic on-demand tool catalog search.
    - Piped Stdout & Terminal Noise Defense: When running tests or build commands with verbose output, pipe stdout through targeted filters (e.g., `pytest | grep -E "(FAILED|ERROR)" -A 5` or `npm test | tail -n 30`) to avoid context window pollution, KV cache degradation, and lost attention.
  </rule>

  <rule id="code_mode_tool_batching">
    Code-Mode Tool Batching (Protocol: code-mode-batching.md):
    - When performing chatty operations (database querying, async job status polling, multi-step API loops), author a targeted script (Python/Bash) to loop and aggregate in a subprocess rather than issuing multi-turn LLM tool calls.
    - Keep intermediate polling out of active context; emit only the final consolidated summary (slashing tokens by 50%–99%).
  </rule>

  <rule id="living_scratchpad_state_management">
    Living Scratchpad Discipline (Combatting Goal & Context Drift - OWASP ASI10):
    - For multi-turn tasks or complex tasks requiring > 3 file edits, the agent MUST maintain a living progress artifact on disk (`state.md` for Full Track, or Sections 3–4 in `task-lite.md`).
    - The state must explicitly track 4 real-time elements: `[Completed items]`, `[Current item]`, `[Known blockers]`, and `[Next steps]`.
    - Update this persistent file immediately after each discrete slice/subtask before advancing. Never rely on volatile conversational memory alone.
  </rule>

  <rule id="cognitive_prompting_and_socratic_inquiry">
    Cognitive Prompting & Socratic Inquiry:
    - Semantic Anchoring: Prioritize standard design patterns (Hexagonal Architecture, Liskov Substitution, Outbox Pattern, Bounded Context) over verbose ad-hoc instructions.
    - Socratic Inquiry: In Research and Innovate, actively formulate and answer up to 3 challenging questions probing unstated assumptions, network failure modes, or concurrency races before settling designs.
  </rule>

  <rule id="no_stale_context">
    Re-read relevant files after any repository change. Never act on stale
    in-memory snapshots.
  </rule>
</context_rules>

</behavior_protocol>
